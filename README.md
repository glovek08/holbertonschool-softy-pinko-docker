# Holbertonschool - Softy Pinko Docker

Containerized app infrastructure with Docker â€“ reverse proxy, load balancer (Round Robin), two API servers, and a front-end server for scalable, portable deployment.

## Resources

* [Docker Tutorial](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/introduction/)
* [Install docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/linux/)
* [Install docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

## Context

Docker is a tool that packages applications and all their necessary components (like libraries and configurations) into isolated environments called containers. This makes applications portable, allowing them to run consistently on any machine, from a developer's laptop to a production server.

The main benefits of using Docker are that its containers are lightweight, fast, and simplify the process of deploying and scaling applications. For the project described, <strong>you will use Docker to build a complete application infrastructure, including a reverse proxy, a load balancer, and multiple servers.</strong>

## Some useful docker commands

<i> *When installing packages through the Dockerfile, what's the `-y` apt-get flag you might ask.
It automatically answers `yes` to all prompts during installation.

### Build image

This will look for a `Dockerfile` so make sure your cwd contains one.
```bash
$ docker build -t <your-docker-image> .
```

  * `docker build`: This is the command to build an image from a Dockerfile.

  * `-t <your-docker-image>`: The -t flag is used to tag the image with a name. I've used my-ubuntu-image as an example, but you can choose any name you like.

  * `.`: The dot at the end of the command specifies that the build context is the current directory (where your Dockerfile is located).

### Run the container

One the image is fully built, use this command to run the container.
```bash
$ docker run <your-docker-image>
```
  * `docker run`: Creates and starts the new container.

  * `<your-docker-image>`: The name of the image to run.
